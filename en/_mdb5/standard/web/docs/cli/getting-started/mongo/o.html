      If you have even little experience with backend technologies you may have noticed that there
      is a lot of options when it comes to data storage. There is a whole variety of database
      systems and each of them has its strong sides. It's not possible to explain all of them in a
      single article - it would probably take a few books to do so. Instead, we will focus on one
      specific database here - MongoDB. Let's dive in!

          What's so special about MongoDB? Well, it's one of the most popular NoSQL databases out
          there. In case you are wondering what NoSQL is, here's a short explanation for you:
        </p>
        <p class="note note-info">
          <strong>NoSQL</strong> database is a type of database that provides non-tabular way of
          storing data. It refers to non-relational databases which means that you can store data in
          other way than tables with relations (typical for MySQL database for instance).
        </p>
        <p>
          MongoDB is document-oriented. The data is stored in JSON-like <strong>documents</strong>.
          A document is a key-value structure capable of storing any data scheme. It's a very
          convenient concept as it allows you to represent real data very accurately.
        </p>
        <img

          alt=""
        />
        <p>
          Documents are stored in <strong>collections</strong>. They fulfill a similar role as
          tables in relational databases <strong>but</strong> with a very important difference.
          Collections do not enforce any common scheme for the documents stored in a given
          collection. It means that you can have documents with different keys and values (including
          number of keys and the document structure in general) stored in the same collection. Quite
          convenient.

        <p>Let's see how to create an example MongoDB instance using MDB GO.</p>

    <h2 class="mb-4">Creating MongoDB database using MDB GO</h2>

    <div class="row">
      <div class="col-md-12">
        <p>
          Before you create the MongoDB database you need to have MDB CLI installed. If you don't
          have it yet go to the
          <a href="/docs/standard/cli/quick-start/" target="_blank">installation guide</a> and do
          so. It is a very useful tool that will allow you to create the database with a single
          command.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you already have our CLI tool you can create your first MDB GO hosted MongoDB instance.
          First, make sure you are logged in:
        </p>
        <mdbsnippet>
          <code data-lang="shell" data-name="Shell">
            $ mdb login
          </code>
        </mdbsnippet>

        <p>Next, run the following command:</p>
        <mdbsnippet>
          <code data-lang="shell" data-name="Shell">
            $ mdb database init -db mongodb
          </code>
        </mdbsnippet>

        <p>
          You'll be informed that before you create your database you need to create a database
          user. Hit <kbd>Enter</kbd>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now you need to provide your user data and then the database details. Please provide the
          values of your choice. For example:
        </p>
        <pre><code>? Enter username peter
? Enter password Parker_1
? Repeat password Parker_1
? Enter database name spider_shop
? Enter description Test database
</code></pre>
        <p class="note note-warning">
          <strong>Note:</strong> the password must contain <i>at least</i> one uppercase letter, one
          lowercase letter, one number, one special symbol and have minimum length of 7.
        </p>

        <p>
          Hit <kbd>Enter</kbd> and that's it. You just created your own database. Simple, isn't it?
        </p>

        <p>If you provided correct data you should now see something similar to this:</p>
        <pre><code>Warning! Write down the password to your database as we will never show it again.

Info: To connect to this database you need to download Robo3T or another MongoDB client

          These are your credentials that you will need to use to connect to your newly created
          database. It's described in the next section.
        </p>
        <p>
          Before you jump there however, please notice that the username and database name slightly
          differs from what you provided earlier. Don't worry - it's OK. A few random characters
          have been added to these values to randomize them and improve security of your database
          credentials.
        </p>
        <p class="note note-danger">
          <strong>Important:</strong> Do not close your terminal window until you save your
          credentials somewhere. This is the only time we will show you your database password. If
          you won't save it you'll loose it.
        </p>
        <p>Now let's see how to connect to your database.</p>

    <div class="row">
      <div class="col-md-12">
        <p>
          In order to connect to your MongoDB instance we will use the client named NoSQLBooster for
          MongoDB. You can download and install it from
          <a href="https://nosqlbooster.com/downloads" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"
            >the official website</a
          >.
        </p>

        <p>
          After you downloaded and installed NoSQLBooster let's open the client and click
          <i>Connect (1)</i> | <i>Create (2)</i> in the top-left corner of the application window.
        </p>
        <img
          class="img-fluid"
          src="https://mdbootstrap.com/wp-content/themes/mdbootstrap4/content-gh/en/_mdb5/standard/web/docs/cli/getting-started/mongo/img/connection.webp"
          alt="Connection"
        />

        <p>
          Now find the <i>From URI (3)</i> button in the bottom-left part of the window and click
          it.
        </p>

        <p>
          In the text input that popped up paste your <i>Connection String</i> that's been displayed
          by MDB CLI after your database has been created. In my case it's this one:
          <code>mongodb://peter68c6924a:Parker_1@mongo.db.mdbgo.com:8604/spider_shopf60cfe72</code>
        </p>

        <p>
          Click the <i>Test Connection</i> button in the bottom-left corner of the window. If you
          followed all the steps you should see a bunch of text and a green <i>OK</i> at the top of
          the window.
        </p>

        <p>
          Congratulations! You have configured your connection successfully. You can click
          <i>Close</i> | <i>OK</i> and then <i>Save</i> and you will be automatically connected to
          the database.
        </p>

        <p>You can now start using your MongoDB instance. Let's see a few examples.</p>

        <p>
          If you connected to your database you should be able to see available collections in the
          left-hand-side tree view. In our case, you should see the
          <code>hello</code> collection - double-click it. In the tab on the right there is a single
          document with a key <code>message</code> and the value <code>"Hello, world!"</code>. Let's
          see what else you can do with your test collection.
        </p>

        <img
          class="img-fluid"
          src="https://mdbootstrap.com/wp-content/themes/mdbootstrap4/content-gh/en/_mdb5/standard/web/docs/cli/getting-started/mongo/img/hello.webp"
          alt="First element"
        />

        <h3>Querying</h3>
        <p>
          Let's run some queries. We will be working in the query editor now. Please note the green
          arrow button at the top bar of the app window (marked with the red border) - we will be
          using it to run queries:
        </p>

        <img
          class="img-fluid"
          src="https://mdbootstrap.com/wp-content/themes/mdbootstrap4/content-gh/en/_mdb5/standard/web/docs/cli/getting-started/mongo/img/query.webp"
          alt="Query"
        />

        <p>
          In order to read documents you can use the <code>.find()</code> method. It accepts an
          argument where you can provide query options. In order to find all the documents that have
          the key <code>message</code> with value <code>"Hello, world!"</code> you can use the
          following query:
        </p>

        <pre><code>db.getCollection("hello").find({ message: "Hello, world!" })</code></pre>

        <p>
          After you run it with the green arrow button you'll see that it shows only one document -
          the one that you saw earlier. It's hard to tell if the query works if the result is the
          same as earlier. So let's create more documents to be able to play with querying.
        </p>

        <h3>Inserting</h3>
        <p>
          Inserting a document requires using the <code>.insert()</code> method. It accepts an
          argument which is a JSON-like document that you wan't to insert. For example to add a few
          more documents to the <code>hello</code> collection you can run the following queries:
        </p>

        <pre><code>db.getCollection("hello").insert({ message: "I love spiders!" })
db.getCollection("hello").insert({ message: "I don't feel so good :(" })
db.getCollection("hello").insert({ suitType: "Iron-Spider" })
db.getCollection("hello").insert({ suitType: "standard" })
</code></pre>
        <p class="note note-warning">
          <strong>Note</strong> that you can insert different documents to the same collection. The
          <code>suitType</code> key does not match with the <code>message</code> key but MongoDB
          allows you to do that.
        </p>

        <p>
          Now if you run the <code>.find()</code> method with different options you'll see how it
          works.
        </p>

        <h3>Updating</h3>
        <p>
          If you want to update a document you can use the <code>.update()</code> method. You need
          to provide at least two arguments: first the query which will retrieve the documents that
          needs to be updated (the same as in <code>.find()</code>) and second argument is a
          JSON-like object that will provide new values to the document. For example:
        </p>

        <pre><code>db.getCollection("hello").update({ message: "I love spiders!" }, { message: "I hate spiders." })
</code></pre>
        <p>
          This query will change the <code>message</code> value to <code>"I hate spiders."</code>.
        </p>
        <p class="note note-warning">
          <strong>Note</strong> that you can add new keys to the document using
          <code>.update()</code> method. Simply pass the new keys in the second argument.
        </p>

        <h3>Deleting</h3>
        <p>
          In order to delete documents you can use one of the two methods:
          <code>.deleteOne()</code> or <code>.deleteMany()</code>. Both of them accept an argument
          with query options the same as in <code>.find()</code>. The difference is that the former
          will delete only one document even if more will match the query while the latter will
          delete all matching documents. Here's an example:
        </p>

        <pre><code>db.getCollection("hello").deleteOne({ suitType: "Iron-Spider" })
</code></pre>
        <p>Using this query you will delete the first document that matches given criteria.</p>
